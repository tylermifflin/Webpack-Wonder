## Description
Webpack Wonder is a note taking app that can be used online or downloaded and used offline in an app format. This app uses Webpack to create a dist file, service worker, manifest.json, and uses the indexedDB api to store data. I have included screenshots to show the functionality of the app in the browser, offline in the downloaded form, the manifest.json, service worker, and indexedDB.

Here is a link to the deployed application using Heroku: https://webpackwonder-35908a774ded.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
The user will need to copy the repository, have node.js installed on their local computer. The user will then open the outer most package.json in integrated terminal and run npm i to download the dependencies necessary to run the app.
## Usage
After the user has run npm i, the user will make sure they are still in the package.json in the outer most folder and run npm run build. Once the build is complete, the user will enter npm run start and can use the app in the local server.
## License
NA
## Contributing
I worked alone on this project.
## Tests
I ran multiple tests in the local server to make sure all bugs were fixed before deploying to Heroku.
